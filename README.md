# Reservation_system
This is my first complex project. It will be an free app for small restaurants.
At the beginning, programm will have only few simple functions: 
  1) Creates calendar with reservations and notes for those reservations
  2) In settings user will be able to make a map of tables, where tables will be numerated.
  3) In settings will some changeble parameters: changing backgroung, language (I want to set czech, english and russian, may be german too),
     choosing working hours of the restaurant.
  4) In settings will be an option to create a database for menu, clients contacts.
  5) May be I add statistics (number of cleints for different peiods of time, the most popular tables and menu positions,...)
